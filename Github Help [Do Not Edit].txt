Github Help

I will be teaching you how to add files to a github repository (create a github account for this). I will not be teaching you about merging, pull requests, and releases, because we will (for simplicity) be committing everything to the master branch of the repo. 

To commit a file, drag the file into the repository's file list, let it download, then scroll down and hit the green button ("commit changes"), which will push the changes. (It is highly recommended that you write a description of what you just uploaded under the "Commit Changes" section. The small box on top can be your short description, such as "Added New Game Engine File", and the bigger box can be a more detailed lengthy description, such as "Added New Game Engine File That Automatically Creates RNG Movement For Mobs". Again, this is not necessary but highly recommended!)

And that's it!

A note about github file uploading: If a file is already present, it will not create two files. Instead, github will replace the old file, as it recognizes that you are trying to update an old file. If there is no file with the name present it just adds it. For our sake, we will be naming all of our files with our github username then the filename (so mine would be RandomKiddofilename.py) so that way we don't have any duplicate file names. Also, please do not edit or override someone else's file (without their permission at least). Also, do not publish files in someone else's name (I can see who pushed and what files they pushed).
